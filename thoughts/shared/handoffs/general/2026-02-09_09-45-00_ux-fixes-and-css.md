# Handoff: UX Fixes + CSS Design System

## Task(s)

### Completed (This Session)
1. **Pushed to GitHub** - Set up remote and pushed all commits
2. **CSS design system** - Added button components (.btn-primary/secondary/ghost/subtle), unified glass class
3. **Planet shader improvements** - Attempted domain warping/Voronoi (had to revert due to rendering issues)
4. **Fixed GalaxyNavigation overlap** - Changed from vertical-center to fixed top-80 positioning
5. **Added close button to project panel** - X button in top-right, pointer-events enabled
6. **Fixed page scrolling** - Removed overflow:hidden from html/body so work pages scroll

### NOT Completed (Next Session)
1. **Advanced planet shaders** - Domain warping and Voronoi broke rendering; needs careful debugging
2. **Responsive mobile fixes** - ContactSection, KeyboardShortcutsHelp positioning on small screens
3. **Typography scale** - Apply --text-opacity-* tokens consistently
4. **Accessibility** - ARIA labels, role="dialog", color contrast

## Critical References
- src/app/globals.css:98-240 - Button component system
- src/app/globals.css:314-350 - Unified glass morphism
- src/components/ui/HolographicProjectPanel.tsx - Has close button now
- src/components/ui/GalaxyNavigation.tsx:19 - Fixed positioning

## Recent Changes (This Session)

### Commits Pushed
1. `01b546c` - Enhance design system and planet shaders
2. `638fe13` - Add advanced planet shaders (REVERTED)
3. `4e1681e` - Revert planet shader to stable version
4. `ef7d001` - Fix GalaxyNavigation overlapping with hero header
5. `84792c9` - Add close button to project panel
6. `f89144c` - Fix scrolling on work and project pages

### Key File Changes
- globals.css: Removed `overflow: hidden` from html/body (line 75-79)
- HolographicProjectPanel.tsx: Added X close button, changed to pointer-events-auto
- GalaxyNavigation.tsx: Changed `top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2` to `top-80`

## Learnings

1. **Planet shader complexity** - Advanced GLSL features (domain warping, Voronoi) caused planets not to render. The stable version works; advanced features need incremental testing.

2. **Overflow inheritance** - Global `overflow: hidden` on html/body overrides page-level overflow-auto. Remove from global, let pages manage their own.

3. **pointer-events-none breaks interactivity** - The project panel had this class which prevented clicks. Changed to `pointer-events-auto`.

## Action Items & Next Steps

### Priority 1: Debug Planet Shaders (if desired)
- The advanced shader at commit 638fe13 has domain warping and Voronoi
- Needs incremental testing to find what breaks WebGL compilation
- Possibly too many nested fbm() calls or early returns in GLSL

### Priority 2: Mobile Responsive
```
Files:
- ContactSection.tsx - bottom-32 too large on mobile → use responsive: bottom-16 md:bottom-32
- KeyboardShortcutsHelp.tsx - position on small screens
- HolographicProjectPanel.tsx - p-8 too large on mobile → use p-4 md:p-8
```

### Priority 3: Typography & Accessibility
- Apply --text-opacity-primary/secondary/tertiary to text elements
- Add aria-label to MagneticButton
- Add role="dialog" to GalaxyGuide chat panel
- Test WCAG AA contrast for text-white/60
